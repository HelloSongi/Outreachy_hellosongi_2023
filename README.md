Climate change is a pressing global issue that affects everyone and everything on the planet. It is caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes that emit greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun and cause the earth's temperature to rise, leading to various consequences such as more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, floods, and storms, rising sea levels, and loss of biodiversity.

The impact of climate change on the world is significant and far-reaching. It affects natural ecosystems, human health, food security, water resources, energy systems, and the global economy. The poorest and most vulnerable communities are often the most affected by climate change, as they have limited resources and infrastructure to adapt to its effects.

In Zambia, climate change is a serious threat to the country's agricultural sector, which accounts for about 35% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs over 70% of the population. The country is facing recurrent droughts, floods, and erratic rainfall patterns, which reduce crop yields and threaten food security. Climate change also affects the availability and quality of water resources, as well as energy production and infrastructure.

Mitigating and adapting to climate change requires collective action at the global, national, and local levels. Governments, businesses, civil society, and individuals can all play a role in reducing GHG emissions, increasing energy efficiency, promoting renewable energy, conserving natural resources, and building climate-resilient communities.

Moja Global's mission of developing pioneering, open-source software to support ambitious climate action is commendable and aligns with my urgent need to address climate change. By providing accessible and innovative tools, Moja Global can enable more people and organizations to participate in climate action and make informed decisions about their environmental impact. This can lead to more effective and equitable climate solutions and help build a more sustainable future for all.

As a software engineer, I support knowledge sharing and provide information that can be useful to anyone interested in climate change and its impacts. I believe that by being part of this project and using innovative approaches, we can make a significant difference in mitigating and adapting to climate change, protecting the planet, and securing a better future for generations to come.
